Chint DTSU666-20 modbus
This file has been written simply due to the need for it and due to the fact there was no such correct file out there online.
It took months of work with sungrow and translating chinese hex values one by one.... result is the file which works and registers which show values.
NOTE:
It will not fix all your problems as these registers are quie different to anything you have ever been familiar with.
It needs a lot of understanding of what power is and how to use these registers... it is not quite the same as sungrow inverter registers you all know.

NOTE2:
My chint meter is no longed attached to the inverter but it is attached and managed by the Logger1000a
Logger has assigned it modbus number 5 and hence why this file is called modbus_sungrow_5.yaml, so I can easily identify what piece of hardware it relates to.
Each one of you will need ot modify it to suit your setup.
