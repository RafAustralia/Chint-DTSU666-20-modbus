Chint DTSU666-20 modbus
This file has been written simply due to the need for it and due to the fact there was no such correct file out there online.
It took months of work with sungrow and translating chinese hex values one by one.... result is the file which works and registers which show values.
NOTE:
It will not fix all your problems as these registers are quie different to anything you have ever been familiar with.
It needs a lot of understanding of what power is and how to use these registers... it is not quite the same as sungrow inverter registers you all know.
